Please find below the steps to run the Object detection algorithm.

•	Here I will be using the YOLOv3 algorithm for this Project.
•	Since it is a computer vision problem, I intended to use Google colab (like Jupyter) as it is useful for good visualization than a standalone .py file.
•	The code can be viewed as AI_project.ipynb
•	The code is mainly divided into three parts. Pre-requisites stage, training stage, and prediction stage. Please follow the steps to run/test the predictions.

Please click on this below link to get yolo prerequisite folder, which contains few test images and config files needed during the training. Add it to your drive.

Steps to run :

1.	The AI_project.ipynb notebook contains all the necessary steps right above each cell block to execute the code. Before that please ensure the above prerequisite files are added to your google drive.

2.	Please continue with the program execution with AI_project.ipynb, all the required steps are clearly mentioned in the code.
